Now we shed that violence all over
Let mayhem in the streets
From the mountaintop to oceans, we own your every need
It's coming down!
With every breath that we take we can hear that sound
Somebody needs a reaction to stay on the ground
With every breath that we take we can hear that sound
A green-skin apocalypse
A do or die

So Billy heeds the call of fathers
Release high
Through these eyes
