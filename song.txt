Now we shed that violence all over
Let mayhem in the streets
From the mountaintop to oceans, we own your every need
It's coming down!
With every breath that we take we can hear that sound
Somebody needs a reaction to stay on the ground
With every breath that we take we can hear that sound
A green-skin apocalypse
A do or die




Embraces the chi and he praises the weeds
Holding out for the day he can face them
And every day that he trains is a slap in the face to the gods
